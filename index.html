  <h2> My Past </h2>
  <p>   I was born in 2001 in Atlanta, Georgia. Living in Atlanta was short lived
      for me before my parents made the move to South Carolina. They had already
      been considering it before my birth, but decided the trip would be a lot easier
      on my mom if she did not have to make it 7 months pregnant. So a month after
      I was born my parents packed up their lives in Atlanta
      and moved to <a href="http://www.greenvillesc.gov/">Greenville, South Carolina</a>
      where we have remained ever since. </p>

<h2> Present Me </h2>

<p>   The present me is what is pretty much what is expected about my life with the
    beginnings that I had. I live an average life that is boring and monotonous.
    Words that you would expect from your average teen who achieves at an above average
    level only cause he can without much effort.The person who runs when the going gets tough because
    he's never had to try very hard. I live in a two parent household, with a sister who only occassionally comes home due
    to her studies at the University of South Carolina. My parents are God fearing Christians,
    who do their best to go to church and drag me along as much as possible. </p>
<p>     Present me is pretty boring as a person, I quit sports because I didn't care much to do the work. Instead I got
    myself an after school job at Bi-Lo. This is where I work like many other kids my age for minimum wage, for 6 hours after
    school to get a little extra cash for gas and extracurricular activities. To many I seem as if I enjoy a lot
    of things, however I don't have many interest. I enjoy simple things I can do without others directly.
    Activities like playing video games, reading, and watching anime. Along with those activities I enjoy listening
    to music, Tyler, the Creator is my favorite artist at the moment. His new album
    <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tyler-the-creator-flower-boy/"> Flower Boy</a> is the only album
    I listen to consisdently. </p>

<h2> My Future </h2>

<p>   I have a lot planned for my future, but my future is not somthing that I'm not looking foward to.
    Growing up to contribute to society and living a daily routine makes me not look forward to growing up.
    However, we all have to and we all have to prepare for the inevitable future that we have ahead of us.
    I plan on attending the <a href="http://www.sc.edu/">University of South Carolina</a>, then attend
    medical school to become a dentist. I'll live a comfortable middle class life with bills and student loans
    that'll probably last me until I'm 30. I plan on having 2 kids like my parents, I want one girl and one boy. </p>
